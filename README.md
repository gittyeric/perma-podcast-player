# Perma Podcast Player

This is a simple podcast player that remembers where/if it was playing across web page loads (if localStorage is supported on the browser).  Also included is podcast-funct.js, a rewrite of podcast.js that is (almost) purely in the style of functional programming, as presented at Vantechy.

## Running
